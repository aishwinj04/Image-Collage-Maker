### Image Collage Maker

This Python program creates a collage of images by arranging them in a grid with margins. It reads images from a directory and arranges them into a grid. The final collage is saved as a new image file.

### Features:
- Organizes images in a grid based on user input.
- Adds margins between images for better spacing and appearance that the user specifies.
- Works with images in a specified directory (ignores `.DS_Store` files on macOS).
- Saves the final collage as a new image (`grid.JPG`).
- Uses functions for code reusability 

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
